## 🎯 Framework Goals

Aspectly is designed to solve the complex problem of communication between different environments:

- **React Native ↔ WebView**: Seamless communication between native apps and web content
- **Parent Window ↔ Iframe**: Reliable iframe communication in web applications
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across iOS, Android, and Web platforms
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Promise-based API**: Modern async/await patterns for clean code
- **Automatic Platform Detection**: Works in WebView, iframe, and browser environments
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Reliable message passing with response handling
- **Event System**: Subscribe to bridge events for monitoring and debugging
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery mechanisms
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support

## 📱 Platform Support
